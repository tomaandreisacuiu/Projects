# Projects
A collection of projects which I worked on during my first year of university.

The projects AsteriskSudoku, GuessingGame (advanced), GuessingGame (basic), PrisonersDilemma, and RandomArtist were created 
at the Eindhoven University of Technology's Java Programming course.Â 
These captivating projects were completed in pairs, with effort split as evenly as possible. Thanks to these projects, I evolved from 
basic programming principles to control structures, recursion, methods, attributes, contructors, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, 
interfaces, working with packages, file handling and exceptions.  
The course concluded with the creation of desktop applications using the Swing framework. 
The average grade obtained for these homework project is 8.9/10.

My work for my university's Data Analytics course are represented by the eight Juptyter notebooks. 
These projects provided me with valuable experience in implementing data engineering tasks in Python. Statistical principles, SQL, 
cleaning data, data transformations, data visualization, analyzing and modeling data are some of the topics addressed and applied 
in Python with Jupyter Notebooks.
